#Quantum physics concepts:-

# (Superposition): anything it could be, (zero, one, both).
#Ex: if we have a mug in superposition it could contain anything (Tea, Coffe, Water or all of them).



# (Entanglement): if two Qbits are entangled, change in one causes change in the another one instanluiolsy.
# apps: transforming information faster than the speed of light



# Space/state size of classical computer VS quantum computer:
  # Classifical: n_of_bits * 2 (because it is zero/one)

  # Quantum: 2 ^ n_of_bits (that's fucking huge) (Exponential massive number of states)



# Note:
  # Quantum computer solves the impossible problems that can't be solved by classical computer or take a very long time.



# Apps of Quantum:

# 1. Encryption.
# 2. Trying and getting vaccine for specefic virus.
# 3. getting the factorial of large numbers.



# let's solve this problem: (how to find best/optimal path of specefic maze)?
  # if we apply classical: the computer will apply brute-force-manner by checking all possible paths one-by-one.
  # if we apply quantum: the computer will check all paths (analyze all of them all at once).
